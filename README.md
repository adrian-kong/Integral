# Integral

Currently approximating integral of functions using [Riemann/Trapezoidal]. Given this is only an approximation, there is an issue regarding floating point accuracy. Also, note this is a hard coded program. There is no parsing inputs and all inputs are taken from inside the code. To implement other functions, y value must be modified accordingly.
